Journal Entry: Slowly I am understanding how the parent/child are communicating with eachother. Accessing each property is coming along ok. I am going to have to take some time at looking how this is taking shape over the weekend. The presentation on the code review helped out *immensely*. Will be looking at the white board and reviewing the video from today.
Specificaly forms, these made total sense and so did the filtering. Again, it was just how to have the paths connect to eachother that I am hitting a wall one. I am **ALMOST** there.

Number and name of feature: **Display a Modal**

Estimate of time needed to complete: 2hrs

Start time: 3:20pm
(couple hour break for dinner with family and quiz)
Finish time: 9:00pm

Actual time needed to complete: 4hrs

Journal Entry: Everything that I could break I broke, I think? I broke the site a couple of times and rendered it back up one more time than I broke it. That is key.
Modal functioning was a big AhHah, accessing and changing the functonality in Modal as children to props being called in App.Js, a couple of brain cells grew at that moment! I mean, I heard those terms being tossed around, and I get it. But it actually started sinking in a bit more the more I struggled with it.
A question that I had for this is, why wouldn't Modal have an `img, ul, and li` component to it as `header` and `title` do?
